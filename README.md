# ActiveRecord

This package implements a subset of the functionality of ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails,
which is a object relational mapper (ORM) for working with relational databases.

Currently it supports many operations on a single table.

Currently it works with MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite.
Support for more databases may be added in the future.

A good set of SUnit tests is included.

This does not yet support joins or transactions.
I intend to add support for both soon.

This also does not support migrations.
I have not yet decided whether I will add support for those.
